## Portal Site and Methods

#### Methods:

[Methods.md](Methods.md) contains a complete description of the methods for data collected at the site.

#### Site Description:

[Figure 1](../SiteandMethods/figures/Portal_Figure1.tif) is a visualization of the entire site. The entire study area is approximately 20 ha and within this area there are 24 experimental plots. Each plot is 0.25 ha (50m x 50m) and fenced with hardware cloth topped with aluminum flashing. Access to these plots by rodents is regulated by gates cut into fencing.

In [Portal_UTMCoords](Portal_UTMCoords.csv) we have provided GPS coordinates for the rodent stakes, plant quadrats, plot corners, and the weather station.


#### Treatments: 

As a result of direct changes to the plots, or the termination of experimental manipulations, changes in treatment assignment occurred in 1985, 1987, 2005, 2009 and 2015. These changes are described in [Portal_plot_treatments](Portal_plot_treatments.csv).

[Portal_plots](Portal_plots.csv) can be used to correctly assign each plot's treatment over time.


Please refer to [Methods.md](../SiteandMethods/Methods.md) for a complete description of how these data were collected.
