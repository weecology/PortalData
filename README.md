Official Repo of the Portal Project Data

[Methods.md](SiteandMethods/Methods.md) contains a full description of the methods for all data.

Detailed descriptions of individual data components are located in README.md files in the individual data folders.

Also see our living data paper for a full description, metadata, citation, authors: [The Portal Project: a long-term study of a Chihuahuan desert ecosystem](https://doi.org/10.1101/332783)

If you'd like some help using the data, try the **[portalr package](https://github.com/weecology/portalr)**. There we provide functions to summarize the data using our suggested methods. Also on **[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/portalr/index.html)**.
